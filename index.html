            Denise Stark lives in the Denver area with her son, husband, and her 
            Great Pyrenees mix.  Having earned a college degree in Earth Sciences 
            at the University of Northern Colorado, she ultimately branched out and 
            built a career in the banking industry before departing from that career 
            5 years ago to dedicate more time to raising her son and buying groceries 
            for her husband.  With a desire to exercise her mental faculties, the 
            analytical problem solving challenges of software development make it an 
            ideal place for her to etch out a new career.
            <br>
            <br>
            Denise will graduate from Denver University's first all-woman coding bootcamp 
            in the Spring of 2019 and hit the ground running in Denver's amazing tech-centric 
            landscape.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a well-rounded individual, she is also an enthusiastic cyclist and snowboarder
            while also being a strong proponent of biker safety laws, loves the mountains, 
            and enjoys taking her dog for walks.
